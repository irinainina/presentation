### Agile software development
 
Слайд 1

Problems with traditional software development

Слайд  2	

Traditional:
- phased development;
- anticipated result;
- up-front design.

Слайд  3	

The Waterfall model software development  is the earliest approach that was used for software development. It is very simple to understand and use. In a waterfall model, each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin.

Слайд  4	

When to use the waterfall model:
-	Requirements are very well known, clear and fixed.
-	Technology is understood.
-	There are no ambiguous requirements
-	Resources with required expertise are available
-	The project is short.

Слайд  5	

The Waterfall model model works perfectly in the conditions of clear, unchanged, well-known requirements. But there are many problems for the implementation of this model.

Слайд  6	

End-users don't know what they want.

Слайд  7	

Customers don't know what their requirements.

Слайд  8	

Developers don't know future difficulties when designing a new software product.

Слайд  9	

Requirements change
-	changes get more and more expensive
-	customers don't get what they want

Слайд  10	

Project Takes Too Long
-	32% of projects delivered successfully
-	Long duration defers revenue

Слайд  11	

No Time for Testing
-	Quality assurance gets crunched
-	Late integration means late failures

Слайд  12	

Time Wasted on Junk
-	52% of requirements implemented
-	64% of functionality rarely used

Слайд  13	

The waterfall model of software development does not work well if the requirements for the product are not known in advance and are changed during the development.

Слайд  14	

There is a need for a new software development model.

Слайд  15	

On February, 2001 at Snowbird ski resort of Utah, seventeen people met to talk, ski, relax, and try to find common ground. The result of this meeting was a Agile ‘Software Development’ Manifesto.

Слайд  16

The actual definition of Agile is found in the Agile Manifesto.
The Manifesto makes it clear that Agile isn’t a methodology.
It isn’t a specific way of doing software development.
It isn’t a framework or a process.

Слайд  17	

Agile is a set of values and principles.

Слайд  18	

Much of the discussion around Agile has to do with following different practices, using various methodologies, and even developing with specific tools.
Agile is really a collection of beliefs that teams can use for making decisions about how to do the work of developing software.
Agile doesn’t make decisions for you.
Instead it gives a foundation for teams to make decisions that result in better software development.

Слайд  19

The Agile Manifesto is only 68 words and very simply says that we can develop software better by valuing the items on the left side of the list more than the items on the right side.
This is the Agile Manifesto says:

Слайд  20	

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

Слайд  21	

When you allow each person to contribute unique value to your software development project, the result can be powerful.

Слайд  22	

Working software over comprehensive documentation

Слайд  23	

It doesn't mean that you should not create documentation; it means you should create documentation that provides value

Слайд  24	

Customer collaboration over contract negotiation 

Слайд  25	

Customer/vendor relationships are much better when the two are working together as partners

Слайд  26	

Responding to change over following a plan 

Слайд  27	

That is, while there is value in the items
on the right, we value the items on the left more.

Слайд  28	

In addition to the values of the Manifesto there are 12 principles that support the values.
Once again the principles are very general and are less about telling you what to do 
than they are about giving you the ability to make a good decision in a particular situation.

Слайд  29	

The principles are:
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

Слайд  30	

A Minimum Viable Product is the smallest thing you can build that that you can offer to customers and observe their actual behavior with the product or service. Seeing what people actually do with respect to a product is much more reliable than asking people what they would do.

Слайд  31	

Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.

Слайд  32

Making changes to the conditions of agile software development use is faster and less expensive.

Слайд  33	

Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
This principle is a clever way of saying, how first two principles can be realized.
To deliver working software frequently, delivery cycles need to be short so the feedback cycles.  Generally speaking shorter cycles are better.

Слайд  34	

How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time!
Likewise, agile development projects are delivered in small bite-sized pieces, delivering small, incremental *releases* and iterating.

Слайд  35	

Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

Слайд  37	

Build projects around motivated individuals.

Слайд  38	

Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

Слайд  39	

The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

Слайд  40	

The code solves the problems of people, but to understand exactly what these problems are, it is possible only in the process of communication.

Слайд  41	

Working software is the primary measure of progress.

Слайд  42

Productivity  it’s not how many hours you work, what your professional qualifications are or what you know – it’s how often your team produces a working software for the customer.

Слайд  43	

Agile processes promote sustainable development.

Слайд  44	

The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. 

Слайд  45	

Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

Слайд  46	

Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One of them writes code while the other reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
While reviewing, the observer also considers the "strategic" direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address. This is intended to free the driver to focus all of their attention on the "tactical" aspects of completing the current task.

Слайд  47	

Simplicity – the art of maximizing the amount of work not done – is essential.

Слайд  48	

Backlog is a list of all the works for which we will get the final product.
There are 2 types of backlog: product backlog and sprint backlog.
The product backlog is a complete list of all works.
Sprint backlog is a list of works for the nearest reporting period (sprint). The tasks in the sprint backlog are taken from the product backlog.

Слайд  49	

Since backlog is a queue of user stories, often such a list can quickly become overloaded.
In a good backlog enough tasks for 2-3 sprints
User stories are clear to all team members.
Stories rated by team
User stories have a size that allows you to implement several of them in one sprint

Слайд  50	

The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

Слайд  51	

All conditions, support and complete trust are created. The team itself organizes the optimal process.

Слайд  52	

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

Слайд  53	

The decision making process matters.
You can’t try to short circuit things by taking decisions made by another team and just blindly doing what they decided to do.
Simply trying to mimic another team’s actions and practices won’t make your team Agile.

Слайд  54

After World War II Melanesian islanders were observed trying to bring cargo planes and their supplies from the sky by mimicking the practices they had seen performed during the war.

Слайд  55

This included clearing the forest to make a landing strip complete with full size planes made out of straw.
They also created structures that mimicked a control tower out of bamboo and had someone sit in it wearing headphones fashioned from coconuts.
It is easy to fall into a similar type of cargo cult mentality when it comes to Agile.
It is less important what practices a team happens to be using than why they are using it.
That isn’t to say it is useless to look at practices being used by teams that are
performing well, but you can’t go looking for practices to make you Agile.
Your principles and values are what will make you Agile.
